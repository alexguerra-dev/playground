## VSCode

## Thoughts

## Look and feel

I would like to get my zoom and font size a way that works for me. I kind of like chunky icons.
But, I also like the editor to feel a little minimalistic.

> Does it make a difference if I know I have changed a line? I a probably going to commit the changes regardless of the number of changes I have made to the project.

### Background

I like the idea of having an image for the background. I should see if there is a `.vscode` folder in my home directory. I could make a folder for the background images and then link to them.

> [!tip] Background
> Is there a folder I can use to hold my background images?
> There is infact a `.vscode` folder in my home directory. I am not sure how volitile it is. So I am going to keep my images in `~/Pictures/vscode`. This seems like a good out of the way place and I can keep it in source control.

#### Vim

> [!question] Focus Editor
> How do I focus the editor after selecting the file in the _explorer_?
> What can be the tiny workflow? 0. Get into the file tree. `Shift + Cmd + E`

1. Explore the file tree
   - Use `j` and `k` for going up and down
   - Use `h` and `l` to open and close the folders
2. Open the file in the editor with `space` **NOTE:** return will rename
3. To focuse on the text in the editor you can use `Cmd + <window group number>`

That seems to be what I want todo to help minimize the use of the mouse. What could the next thing I do to change my habits of using the mouse be?

This is still another test of me using voice to text.

> The steps that happen when I record text using my voice seems a little bit cumbersome. Once I type my command to end the recording, Whisper keeps its window open and I have to press escape. Then, when I'm inside of my editor, I have to press escape again to get out of insert mode. That seems to be a little bit cumbersome.

> [!tip] Change the setting
> Change the setting for wisper to close after finishing pasting the transcription.
> It will have a log of all the text anyway. So, there is no reason to keep the window open.

### Profiles

### My Keybindings

- show/hide finder: `\<leader\> f f`

I am not sure what `:bprevious` and `:bnext` do. I think they are for switching between buffers. I am not sure what a buffer is.

I think it would be good to be able to stage all changes and then go to the source control tab. I have changed the focus git keybinding to `Shift + Cmd + g g`. I can remember the _g_ is for git. To stage all changes I can use `Shift + Cmd + g s`

I think that is enough.thing to work.going to get this dictation thing to work.

I am going to get this Dictation thing to work.I'm going to try a different dictation software.
I think the murmur type might be more responsive in terms of how fast the application opens.
I would like to keep track of how many AI tokens I have with SetApp.
