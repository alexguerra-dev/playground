## Look and feel

I would like to get my zoom and font size a way that works for me. I kind of like chunky icons.
But, I also like the editor to feel a little minimalistic.

> [!question] Focus Editor
> How do I focus the editor after selecting the file in the _explorer_?
> What can be the tiny workflow? 0. Get into the file tree. `Shift + Cmd + E`

1. Explore the file tree
   - Use `j` and `k` for going up and down
   - Use `h` and `l` to open and close the folders
2. Open the file in the editor with `space` **NOTE:** return will rename
3. To focuse on the text in the editor you can use `Cmd + <window group number>`

That seems to be what I want todo to help minimize the use of the mouse. What could the next thing I do to change my habits of using the mouse be?

This is still another test of me using voice to text.

> The steps that happen when I record text using my voice seems a little bit cumbersome. Once I type my command to end the recording, Whisper keeps its window open and I have to press escape. Then, when I'm inside of my editor, I have to press escape again to get out of insert mode. That seems to be a little bit cumbersome.

> [!tip] Change the setting
> Change the setting for wisper to close after finishing pasting the transcription.
> It will have a log of all the text anyway. So, there is no reason to keep the window open.
